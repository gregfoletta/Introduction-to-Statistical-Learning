## 6.5.1 - Best Subset Selection

We wish to predict a baseball player's salary on the bassis of various statistics associated with the performance in the previous year. Let's remove the players for which the salary is missing from the dataset.

```{r 6.5.1_a}
hitters <- hitters %>% dplyr::filter(!is.na(Salary))
```
