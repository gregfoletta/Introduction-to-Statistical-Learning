## 1)
*Using basic statistical properties of the variance, as well as single-variable calculus, derive (5.6). In other words, prove that α given by (5.6) does indeed minimize Var(αX + (1 − α)Y ).*

The formula 5.6 is:
$$ \alpha = \frac{\sigma^2_Y - \sigma_{XY}}{\sigma^2_X + \sigma^2_Y - 2\sigma_{XY}} $$

*We will now derive the probability that a given observation is part of a bootstrap sample. Suppose that we obtain a bootstrap sample from a set of n observations.*

### a) 
*What is the probability that the first bootstrap observation is not the jth observation from the original sample? Justify your answer.*

There is a 1/n chance that the observation is in
